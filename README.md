# Imbalanced-Fraud-Detection

This is a classification project to establish if credit card transaction is fraud or not.

I have reduced the number of features down to 10 from initial number of 30 by identifing the most influenstial features.

I have improved the quality of the model primarily by finding the best AUC_ROC score to achieve a sensible recall and precision scores.

I have implemented Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier(SVC) and combine the best results from them through Stacking Classifier to get an ven better model for the objective.

In order to execute this project and see all the process, visiualization, comments and flowchart diagram please run __Main__.ipynb.
